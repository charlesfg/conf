🛠 How to Corrupt a PDF
Use the corrupt_pdf.py script with one of the following modes:


python corruption_scripts/corrupt_pdf.py <path_to_pdf> <corruption_type> <output_path>
Supported Corruption Types
truncate: Cuts the file short

flip: Flips random bytes

header: Corrupts the PDF header

🕵️ How to Validate a PDF
Check if a file is a proper PDF using:


python validation_scripts/validate_pdf.py <path_to_pdf>
This script checks:

PDF magic number

Readability via PyPDF2

Extractability via pdfminer

🧪 Run the Full Test
Use the test_all.py script to run both corruption and validation on a sample PDF:


python tests/test_all.py <path_to_valid_pdf>
📘 Jupyter Tutorial
